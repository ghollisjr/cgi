cgi is a library for making CGI applications Common Lisp using SBCL.
The explicit dependency on SBCL is due to the use of sbcl-script to
ease script management, as the model of CGI applications envisioned by
the author is to use SBCL to load core files as part of Lisp scripts.

(Note that make-sbcl-core from sbcl-script must be installed in your
PATH in order to use the Makefile as written.)

For example, provided you built /path/to/cgi.core with make-sbcl-core
as in the Makefile, you could have a Lisp file

webapp.cgi:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/usr/bin/env -S sbcl --core /path/to/cgi.core --script

;; Enable non-script library use without slowing down scripts
(when (not (member :script *features*))
  ;; assuming cgi can be found by quicklisp:
  (ql:quickload "cgi"))

(defun somefunc ()
  ...)

;; Like Python's "if __name__ == '__main__':"
(when (member :script *features*)
  (somefunc))
----------------------------------------------------------------------

that could be placed in your web server's CGI directory to provide a
CGI web app, and provided that your ~/.sbclrc handles the #!... at the
start of the file, this script would be both a loadable Lisp library
file and an executable script.

For reference, your ~/.sbclrc could look like this:

~/.sbclrc:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
;; Ignore all #! characters
(set-dispatch-macro-character
 #\# #\!
 (lambda (stream char arg)
   (declare (ignore char arg))
   (read-line stream)))
----------------------------------------------------------------------

and support loading executable Lisp scripts as library files.  This
has the same advantages that it has in other languages like Python in
that you can easily test and reuse scripts without always executing
them.

See examples/ for some example scripts.
